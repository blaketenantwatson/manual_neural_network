# manual_neural_network
Neural network implemented in python without the use of ml packages

## Description
This project contains the following file layout:
```
/datasets/
/test_cases/

.gitignore
LICENSE
README.md
test.py
NeuralNet.py
NeuralNetUtil.py
```

#### test.py
This file contains all test functions for the program. This runs a full suite of tests to confirm all code is working properly.

#### NeuralNet.py
This file contains the main functions and implementations for the neural network.

#### NeuralNetUtil.py
This file contains assisting functions for NeuralNet.py, including dataset handling and other helper functions

## Executing Program
While the NeuralNet.py can be imported and utilized directly, running the test.py file will run a large suite of tests utilizing the given neural network.

## Credits
This project was completed as part of CS3600 at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and a significant portion of the code was provided by the teaching staff. All proper credit is given to the GaTech teaching staff and TAs for their portions of the presented code.
